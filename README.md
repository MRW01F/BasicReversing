# BasicReversing
Reversing for 5yo

I have created a simple binary that contains a logic for finding prime number

the binary "Reverseme" is compiled in Linux, use ghidra to decompile it & get the C code.

compare it with the code in "Reverseme.cpp" and understand how ghidra decompiles it.

Then after see the "Reverseme.objdump" which is an output of objdump, which contains assembly dump.
use it to understand how c code interprets in the assembly. (use https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ for the reference)

then finally see the "Reverseme.asm" for the actual assembly code extracted with GDB debugger.

this should help you to understand how C code gets interpreted in the assembly & understanding how assembly language executes the operations.
